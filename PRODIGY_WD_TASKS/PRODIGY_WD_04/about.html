    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, I am Ramamoorthy AS, and I am 19 years old. I live in Perambur. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's in computer science engineering at the Chennai Institute of Technology. I have done my schooling at Vivekananda Vidhyalaya. My talents are cooking and swimming. I am pretty good at coding and programming. My aim is to become a successful software developer for a well-recognized company. And my short-term goal is to do my master's in computer science abroad. My strengths are that I am a hard worker, a quick learner, and self-motivated. And that's all about me, thank you!</p>
